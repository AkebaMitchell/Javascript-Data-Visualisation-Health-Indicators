# Data-Visualisation-Health-Indicators
Buidling web data visualisations for the East Africa Research Health Commission's websit whilst working at Manta Ray Media. 
The visualisations are mocked up using open source datasets from the WHO website (http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main)

These will later be integrated with the backend in Drupal to allow the charts to be automatically updated ont he website when data is imported by the client.
